# Automatic-Door-Opener
Lab Projects Developed in ECE298

This project automates an entry/exit doorway to a customer site that senses customers automatically with programmable trigger levels for proximity. There are four labs to finish the project. The work done in each lab is described below and in the reports. Some detailed information of this project can be seen on Page 8 of [project overview.pdf](https://github.com/k5xing/Project-Overview/blob/main/project%20overview%20-%20Kehan%20Xing.pdf), and the code programmed in Lab3 is in [STM32_Workspace/Lab3/Core/Src/main.c](https://github.com/k5xing/Automatic-Door-Opener/blob/main/Lab3%20%20-%20Prototype%20Phase%201/STM32_Workspace/Lab3/Core/Src/main.c).
